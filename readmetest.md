# Phase 3 Project - SyriaTel Dataset

Primary Repository for Mason Walter's Phase 3 Project

### Project Overview / Business Problem

Build a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company.

Most naturally, my audience here is the telecom business itself, interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long. The question I'm asking is: Are there any predictable patterns here?

### The Data

For this project I chose to use the SyriaTel Dataset provided on Kaggle.  It is a binary problem therefore is fairly straightforward in goals
for the models as well as interpretation of results.
